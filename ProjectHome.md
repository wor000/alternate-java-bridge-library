The AltBridge is an Eclipse plugin for developing Android apps. The library contained was built from App Inventor's Java Bridge library. If you've used App Inventor, most of the methods will make sense. The idea being to bridge the gap between programming in App Inventor and programming in Eclipse with the Android SDK.

However, since it's inception, the AltBridge has been getting more and more efficient, and flexible. Because of this, it's a good compliment to programming for Android for people who haven't used App Inventor, as well as those who have.
