# HorizontalScrollArrangement #

This works the same way a HorizontalArrangement works, only this is scrollable (horizontally).

## Note ##

> Scrollviews only accept one child. This means that if you want to place multiple things into the scroll view, you must first place another arrangement within it. So, place a horizontalarrangement within the horizontalscrollarrangement, then you can add whatever you want into the horizontalarrangement (which all gets placed into the horizontalscrollarrangement).

I hope that makes sense.
