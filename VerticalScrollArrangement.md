# VerticalScrollArrangement #

This works the same as the HorizontalScollArrangement, only this one will scroll vertically.

## Note ##

> Scrollviews only accept one child. This means that if you want to place multiple things into the scroll view, you must first place another arrangement within it. So, place a verticalarrangement within the verticalscrollarrangement, then you can add whatever you want into the verticalarrangement (which all gets placed into the verticalscrollarrangement).

I hope that makes sense.
